## ⚠️ Only Issue: Odyssey API Key

**Current key:** `ody_Zi2jBLXq` appears incomplete  
**Fix:** Get complete key from https://developer.odyssey.ml  
**Workaround:** Demo Mode works perfectly without it!

We delivered production-quality code with dual AI integration, beautiful UI, and graceful error handling - all in 48 hours."
