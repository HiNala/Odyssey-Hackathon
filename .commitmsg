Add character archetype quick-select and battle stream retry logic

- Add character-library.ts with pre-defined character archetypes (name, character, world)
- SetupForm: quick-select buttons to auto-fill character and world from archetypes
- Filter archetypes by player (even/odd index) so each player gets unique options
- useGameFlow: retry battle stream start once with 2s delay on failure
- Gracefully continue game without video if all stream attempts fail
