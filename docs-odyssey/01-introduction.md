# Introducing the Odyssey API

> A new form of multimodal intelligence.

Odyssey-2 Pro is a general-purpose world model, enabling new kinds of consumer, enterprise, and intelligence applications.

Odyssey-2 Pro outputs continuous, interactive simulations that can now be embedded into your application in multiple ways. We've built three API endpoints—interactive streams, viewable streams, and simulations—to support both online, real-time generation and offline, batch workflows. Together, they enable builders to integrate world models in many ways.
